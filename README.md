# florence-captioning

A script to caption images using Florence-2-large.
Script is presented as is and will probably not work out of the box for everyone. Requirements are probably *NOT* complete.
Might help some get the right idea though. If somebody wants to finish it, feel free to.

It will generate a .txt file for jpegs, pngs and gifs.
Every .txt file will have the same name as file.

Cheers
