# florence-captioning

A script to caption images using Florence-2-large.
Script is presented as is and will probably not work out of the box for everyone. Requirements are probably *NOT* complete.
Might help some get the right idea though. If somebody wants to finish it, feel free to.

It will generate a .txt file for jpegs, pngs and gifs.
Every .txt file will have the same name as file.

How to use:
- Create venv
- Install requirements e.g. pip install -r requirements.txt (they might be incomplete)
- Change path to your image files in make_captions.py
- Run python make_captions.py 

Cheers
